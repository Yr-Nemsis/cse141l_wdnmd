## Team: WDNMD
Notes for walkthrough:
1. The top level file is ```top_leve.sv``` and all other ```.sv``` files are named as their functionality. 
2. For more specific details of how each module works, go to the file and check out the comment. 
3. To use testbench, it is recommended to look through mach_code_comment.txt to see what the instructions are actually doing. (The format is following the ARM/MIPS standard)

All tests passed. All program work.
